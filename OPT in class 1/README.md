The planned path begins at the Bunker, then proceeds to the Gas Station, Hospital, Pharmacy, and finally the Grocers1 store before returning to the Bunker. This route was generated using a shortest-path + Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) framework. We first modeled the town as a weighted road network, where each streetâ€™s distance served as the travel cost. By computing all-pairs shortest paths, we ensured that only the safest and most direct streets were used. Then we solved a small tsp with the key points, Gas Station, Hospital, Pharmacy, and Groceries. The approach guranteed every critical point is visited, and find the mimal distance.
